            <p>Biodiversity comprises all living forms that we see around us. These include all essential goods and services we derive from the environment. Therefore, we can say that we depend on the richness of biodiversity for our survival. Any alteration in the biodiversity of species can affect our lives whether directly or indirectly.</p>
        
            <p>It is sad to know that these diverse life forms are exploited and unmanaged. Some components are becoming endangered, worst they are becoming extinct. This is the best time to find ways and act to protect and preserve our environmental resources.</p>
